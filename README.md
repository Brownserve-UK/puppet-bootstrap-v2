# Puppet bootstrap scripts

This repository contains a set of scripts to bootstrap the installation and configuration of a Puppet server and Puppet agents.
These scripts are designed to be used in Brownserve environments, but may well be easily adapted to other environments.

The scripts have been tested on the following operating systems:

`bootstrap_puppet-linux.py`:
    - Ubuntu 22.04
    - Ubuntu 24.04

`bootstrap_puppet-windows.py`:
    - Windows Server 2016
    - Windows Server 2019
    - Windows Server 2022
    - Windows 10

`bootstrap_puppet-server.py`:
    - Ubuntu 22.04

## Usage

All scripts can be run fully interactively, or with command line arguments to automate the process.
If you forget to supply a required argument, the script will prompt you for it.
Several checks are performed throughout the process to ensure that the likelihood of failure is minimized.
The script is designed in such a way that it should recover from a failed run, with a simple re-running of the script.

The scripts can also be run completely non-interactively by supplying all required arguments on the command line and passing the `unattended` flag. (see below for more information)
