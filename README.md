# Puppet bootstrap scripts

This repository contains a set of scripts to bootstrap the installation and configuration of a Puppet server and Puppet agents.
These scripts are designed to be used in Brownserve environments, but may well be easily adapted to other environments.

The scripts have been tested on the following operating systems:

`bootstrap_puppet-linux.py`:
    - Ubuntu 22.04
    - Ubuntu 24.04

`bootstrap_puppet-windows.py`:
    - Windows Server 2016
    - Windows Server 2019
    - Windows Server 2022
    - Windows 10

`bootstrap_puppet-server.py`:
    - Ubuntu 22.04

## Usage

All scripts can be run fully interactively, or with command line arguments to automate the process.
If you forget to supply a required argument, the script will prompt you for it.
Several checks are performed throughout the process to ensure that the likelihood of failure is minimized.
The script is designed in such a way that it should recover from a failed run, with a simple re-running of the script.

The scripts can also be run completely non-interactively by supplying all required arguments on the command line and passing the `unattended` flag. (see below for more information)

## Examples

You can find some examples of how to use the bootstrap scripts in the [EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md) file.

## Development

> ℹ Please keep in mind the philosophy of these scripts is to be simple yet powerful.
They should guide a novice user through the process of bootstrapping a Puppet server or agent, but also allow an experienced user to automate the process.

### Building the Python scripts

The `bootstrap_puppet-linux.py` and `bootstrap_puppet-server.py` scripts share a lot of the same code.
Therefore to cut down on duplication, the shared code has been moved into a separate file called [`common.py`](.build/PuppetPython/common.py) this is then combined with the main script files ([`puppet_agent.py`](.build/PuppetPython/puppet_agent.py) and [`puppet_server.py`](.build/PuppetPython/puppet_server.py)) to create the final scripts.

To build the scripts, simply run the following command from the root of the repository:

```powershell
.\.build\PuppetPython\build.ps1
```

This will update the `bootstrap_puppet-linux.py` and `bootstrap_puppet-server.py` scripts in the root of the repository, with any changes made to the `puppet_agent.py` and `puppet_server.py` files in the `.build/PuppetPython` directory.

### Testing

In the `.build` directory you will find a Vagrantfile that can be used to test the scripts in a controlled environment.

#### Pre-requisites

* Vagrant (Tested with version 2.4.1)
* VirtualBox (Tested with version 7.0.14)
* At least 16GB of RAM on the host machine

#### Running the tests

To run the automated tests, simply run the following command from the `.build` directory:

```bash
vagrant up
```

This will first bootstrap the Puppet server and then 2 agents - one Windows and one Linux.
All 3 machines will be bootstrapped using the scripts in this repository in unattended mode.

If you wish to run the tests in interactive mode, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
vagrant up auto-puppetserver manual-linux-agent manual-windows-agent
```

This will spin up a Puppet server and 2 agents, the Puppet server will be bootstrapped in unattended mode, however the agents won't be bootstrapped at all.
You can then `vagrant ssh` or `vagrant winrm` into the machines and run the scripts manually.
The scripts should be available in the `/puppet_bootstrap` directory on the machines.
